# hello-world
This is my personal repo for integration with TeamCity
Hello GitHub!
This little bit of code will help me text commands in commits to my project in TeamCity. Woohoo!
I just opened this readme file and added some text. Amazing.
Here's my first commit.
Here's my second commit. In this VCS commit, I will fix 80D-1
Here's my third commit. In this VCS extended description, I will apply a comment and use a command
OK - trying again. This should add a comment to issue 80D-3
Now with Issue Tracker enabled in TeamCity - here be go from test 1.
Now I changed my email address to match YouTrack and TeamCity. Ready to pull.
YASS YASSS YASSSS I got pro support from Volfman
OK - didn't work. Now I added my vcs username to my Hub profile. Let's see what happens
Still shitty - now I added my GitHub VCS username to my TeamCity profile. Let's see.
NOOOOO ok now I know to put comments on their own line - let's see.
Now we'll fix 80D-1 and try two lines of comments. Ohhhh yeah
Now let's do this again with both 2 and 3 and see how it goes.
We're going to update this right in the master branch and see what happens.
Gonna fix 80D-3 directly through the GitHub integration
That didn't work - let's try in a pull request...
