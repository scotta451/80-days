# hello-world
This is my personal repo for integration with TeamCity
Hello GitHub!
This little bit of code will help me text commands in commits to my project in TeamCity. Woohoo!
I just opened this readme file and added some text. Amazing.
Here's my first commit.
Here's my second commit. In this VCS commit, I will fix 80D-1
Here's my third commit. In this VCS extended description, I will apply a comment and use a command
OK - trying again. This should add a comment to issue 80D-3
Now with Issue Tracker enabled in TeamCity - here be go from test 1.
Now I changed my email address to match YouTrack and TeamCity. Ready to pull.
YASS YASSS YASSSS I got pro support from Volfman
OK - didn't work. Now I added my vcs username to my Hub profile. Let's see what happens
Still shitty - now I added my GitHub VCS username to my TeamCity profile. Let's see.
NOOOOO ok now I know to put comments on their own line - let's see.
Now we'll fix 80D-1 and try two lines of comments. Ohhhh yeah
Now let's do this again with both 2 and 3 and see how it goes.
We're going to update this right in the master branch and see what happens.
Gonna fix 80D-3 directly through the GitHub integration
That didn't work - let's try in a pull request...
Testing a change to comment behavior in VCS commits
That was ridiculous - nothing happened at all
Added GitHub VCS uersname to profile in YouTrack
Oh man would be nice if this worked
So I've linked the VCS commit to the issue, but the user is not recognized and the additional text is added to the VCS commit.
I've updated the settings in the integration to parse commits for comment text.
Great - was having a conflict with a VCS username for a banned user. Nice
Disabled the Bitbucket integration just in case there was a conflict - even though it's attached to a different project
Removed email address from another banned user account just in case
